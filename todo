Gabriel:
    SEARCH PAGE:
        - tag searching and filtering (needa re-implement body parser)

    NOTIFICATION PAGE:
        - make notifications appear live
            - is an ajax fix, if jquery works for the chat then we can just do that for this  too client side

    EXTRA:
        - handle errors (error message appears)
        - make fields secure
        - update location to work with postal codes or something like that

Jadon:
    - sort out create account screen resizing
    - once Gabriel has configured the blocked user thingy then I need to change interface accordingly
        - according to the PDF the blocked users are not supposed to appear in search so I wont be changing it as far as I can see
    
    - err 1: try again (incorrect login details or some such)
    - err 2: access is denied please login first
    - err 3: umm please try to be less cause this error isnt supposed to happen ;) (ie whatever you feel like making the generic error)
