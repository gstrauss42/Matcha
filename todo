Gabriel:
    CHAT PAGE:
        - DO SOME DB STUFF THERE (CHECK COMMENTS). If you get it to work with the db stuff added then wall is good, if not then 
                tell me and ill ask my friend. I just need your db fetching code there still.

    PROFILE PAGE:
		- pass me the USERNAME of the people who have liked me, viewed me, and who I have viewed (so save the username instead of the email to the db when doing notifications/viewing/liking etc)
        - have to refresh the page again to see an actual change in the images
        - i have added a 'status' to the user schema already (will either be e.g. --> offline: "offline-12:45pm" OR "online")
                so you just need to use that db variable now and change it on login and logoff. 

    SEARCH PAGE:
        - tag searching and filtering

    NOTIFICATION PAGE:
        - make notifications appear live

	MATCHED PAGE:
		- block gives a double header setting warning in the terminal

    EXTRA:
        - handle errors (error message appears)
        - make fields secure
        - update location to work with postal codes or something like that

    BONUS:
        - ajaxify



Jadon:
    - sort out create account screen resizing
    - make the you two are connected thing more pretty under matched profile for starting chat
    - on block make a banner appear stating that the user has been blocked has perhaps a button to then take them where they want to go away or to unblock them
    - for the chat page please send me the email as a hidden input form named email, were already posting so we just need to add the email info
        - my code needs to be uncommented to work once you pass email
