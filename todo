        make sure its being updated by 1 each time a profile is viewed or liked 

    CHAT PAGE:
        - DO SOME DB STUFF THERE (CHECK COMMENTS). If you get it to work with the db stuff added then all is good, if not then 
                tell me and ill ask my friend. I just need your db fetching code there still.

    PROFILE PAGE:
		- pass me the USERNAME of the people who have liked me, viewed me, and who I have viewed (so save the username instead of the email to the db when doing notifications/viewing/liking etc)
        - have to refresh the page again to see an actual change in the images
        - i have added a 'status' to the user schema already (will either be e.g. --> offline: "offline-12:45pm" OR "online")
                so you just need to use that db variable now and change it on login and logoff. 

    SEARCH PAGE:
        - tag searching and filtering

    NOTIFICATION PAGE:
        - make notifications appear live

	MATCHED PAGE:
        - ||||||||--  if someone is blocked then they should be added to the users blocked list, and when 
            fetching that users page again: then you need to determine if that person is blocked using 
                their ID and then send me the variable named "blocked" which will be a 0 or 1. Then i can change
                     the layout based on that outcome  --|||||||||||||||
		- block gives a double header setting warning in the terminal

    EXTRA:
        - location usage MUST default be set to 1. According to pdf
        - handle errors (error message appears)
        - make fields secure
        - update location to work with postal codes or something like that

    BONUS:
        - ajaxify


Jadon:
    - sort out create account screen resizing
    - once Gabriel has configured the blocked user thingy then I need to change interface accordingly
