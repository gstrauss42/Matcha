Gabriel:

    might need to change login from email to username

    SEARCH PAGE:
        - tag searching and filtering (needa re-implement body parser)

    NOTIFICATION PAGE:
        - clearing notifications can be glitchy where they are removed then reappear but are actually gone
        - make notifications appear live
            - is an ajax fix, if jquery works for the chat then we can just do that for this too client side

    EXTRA:
        - handle errors (error message appears)
        - make fields secure
        - update location to work with postal codes or something like that

    - send me a number '4' to the oops page when i type in my email in the FORGOT PASSWORD page so that it notifies the user to check their email for the link
    - send me a number '5' to the oops page when i use an already existing email in create account page
    - send me a number '6' to the oops page when login has failed because my account isnt verified
    - send me a number '7' to the oops page to notify that i should check my email to verify my account once i have 'created account'

    - when i use the link sent to my email (sent to me from 'forgot password') it just takes me to the login page
    - store the usernames in the notifications and in the views, viewed, likes array (only those three arrays)


Jadon:
    - sort out create account screen resizing
    - once Gabriel has configured the blocked user thingy then I need to change interface accordingly
        - according to the PDF the blocked users are not supposed to appear in search so I wont be changing it as far as I can see

    DONE:
    - err 1: try again (incorrect login details or some such)
    - err 2: access is denied please login first
    - err 3: umm please try to be less cause this error isnt supposed to happen ;) (ie whatever you feel like making the generic error)
    - err 4: check email for password reset link
    - err 5: email already exists
    - err 6: account isnt verified
    - err 7: check email for verification link



    modify gps position

    sending me the wrong id for chat page
