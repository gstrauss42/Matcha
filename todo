    LOGIN:
        - status and location are not updating to the DB on login

    STATS:
        - if a username already exists in liked, likes, viewed, views them do not add it again into the DB.

    SEARCH PAGE:
        - only display users that are verified. (isVerified = true).

        - add notification for when a user unlikes you
        - add notification for when someone has sent you a message
